# battleship
The Odin Project JS project to implement the classic game "battleship" using test-driven development.

## Skills Used
- Set up git, webpack, ESLint, Prettier, Jest for modular, test-driven development
- Use map and linked list data structure to quickly retrieve ship information
- Import private npm package from linked-list project by JiwonJJeong
- Manipulate DOM dynamically using dynamic strings and CSS pseudoclasses

- and pass in the nameOfFunc as a string to call the function
